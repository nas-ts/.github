## Quick Start Guide

The quickest way to get up and running with nasts is to use the @nasts/cli (see below) to spin up a new project, this will have everything you need to get started. To take your app further, please see the documentation here.

If you can't be bothered going over to `@nasts/cli`, just run these commands:

```bash
npm i -g @nasts/cli
nasts new project-name
nasts start
```
